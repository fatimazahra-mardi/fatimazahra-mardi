## Hi, I’m Fatima Zahra Mardi👋
Engineering student at EMSI, with a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science from FST Settat.

I see computer science like music🎵.
Networks define the tempo.
Code creates the rhythm.
Data adds depth.
Architecture brings harmony.
When every layer works together, systems become reliable, scalable, and meaningful.

I am passionate about understanding technology end to end, from networks and servers to applications and data.
I enjoy transforming complex ideas into clean, structured, and efficient digital solutions.
